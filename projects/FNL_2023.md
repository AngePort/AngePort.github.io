# Overview of Challenge
As a team collectively have our desired rocket perform the task of containing a duel-deployment system, to reach an altitude of 2000ft in the air. In the descent of the rocket after apogee, an event of using our electronic payload to eject our drogue parachute must be done. As the rocket reaches desired altitude when descending the dual-deployment system will eject its main parachute to provide a safe landing. Having the rocket in relaunchable condition is what's considered a successful launch.

# My experience
In this group project, I was assigned a role as the payload engineer. My task was to fully understand the commercially marketed altimeter/dual-deployment electronic and integrate that into the team's understanding of how we can design the desired outcome of our electronic payload. Being a new intern for the team, I was tasked with learning and comprehending the terms associated with the field of rocketry. Although it was a learning curve, in the end, I found myself comfortable with the working environment and the understanding of rockets and payloads that came with it. This was not just about integrated rocket science but an experience that will sharpen my skills to work with a team, to achieve a goal using methods to get the team organized from preliminary to the final periods of the project.
