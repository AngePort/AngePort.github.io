# Overview
We got to work with Nasa to provide us a outstanding working enviornment where we are given the chance to expand our network. We were provided with the tools and equipment to help us complete a task that would hone our experience with the field of programming, hardware integration, soldering, and documentation of our work. Safety procedures were improtant throughout the project, due to the fact that the tools and enviornment has a potential to harm us, in understadning we are also provided with the knowledge of basic safety and protective personal equipments. In conclusion we got to create a payload that will be integrated into Nasa's rocket to recieve data such as, altitude, humidity, gyroscopic positions, radiation, and velocity.

# Experience
From being on the island of Oahu in Hawaii, it has been a good experience to see parts of the world that I have not yet set foot on. The workshop for RockOn was provided in Virginia at NASA's Wallops facility, and I was provided with an ID to get limited access to their area. Being provided that there were leaders that would assist us in our journey of learning how to create the electronic payload that we desired, their engagement and way of teaching us was very motivating and inspiring to continue my academics and other ambitions that I want to accomplish. RockOn 2023 was one of the best personal experiences due to the fact that it provided me a safe environment to sharpen my skills, but a starting point to put my first stepping stone towards my ambitions.
