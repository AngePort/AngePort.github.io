# Overview of Challenge
  As a team collectively have our desired rocket perform the task of containing a duel-deployment system, and a payload (lander), to 
  reach an altitude of 2500 ft in the air. In the descent of the rocket after apogee, an event of ejecting our payload with its own parachute,
  as well as having the rocket eject its drogue parachute. As the payload lands safely, the rocket near desired altitude when descending 
  will eject its main parachute to provide a safe landing. Having the payload and lander in relaunchable
  condition is what's considered a successful launch.
