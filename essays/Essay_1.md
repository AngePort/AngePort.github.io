I dove into the understanding of JavaScript as a beginner in the field of a new programming language. JavaScript offered me new ideas on how things can be problem-solved, such as using functions or objects to implement a given problem. It was a very exciting experience to learn about coding using JavaScript while doing basic problem understanding through exercises given in my class assignments. It got me hooked on learning much simpler ways to tackle a complex algorithm. I've seen myself many times getting stuck on understanding a problem, but that is the best part about learning a new programming language â€“ I will soon have that 'OH!' moment signifying my one step closer to understanding what I was stuck on.

I have not taken a class on a different programming language such as JavaScript, but I have always wanted to learn how to code. So, I have dipped my toe into programming languages such as Python, C, and C++. Not realizing how they differ from each other during my era of being a complete newbie to programming, diving deep into JavaScript really got me to understand and see how programming languages differ from one another. There is a significant difference in how each programming language's code is written. There is a way to always have a function to do a certain thing in each programming language, but it takes the user a different route when using each language.

I learned many new things, such as having to know what the new and improved versions of JavaScript are implementing to create an easy time for the user to program. Although I believed that there are things that I have learned in the past, going through many of the exercises refreshed my understanding of many basic skills in programming and strengthened it to a certain extent that I would say I am 100 percent much more comfortable with programming than I was before.

The class has provided me with exercises that are considered assignments and WODs, also known as workouts of the day. I find this to have given me anxiety and joy in improving my problem-solving skills. I feel the way I feel about the WODs due to the fact that it is a given problem that we don't prepare for until the day it's been given. Knowing that it could lead to a programming problem really gives me the motivation to always be ready to have a strong comfortability with the programming language I am using and that I should build strong problem-solving skills. I really hope that there are more assignments that are given at home to provide me the time to actually solve the problem with the time I need. This is to help me get comfortable with what I am doing without the stress-free environment of a timed WOD.

Overall, I have and will continue to dig deep into using JavaScript as a language tool for me to program and create ideas that help me strengthen my comfortability in the field of programming. The class that I am taking has given me the routine that will contribute to improving the skill of programming that I wish to achieve. JavaScript so far has been a very good programming language for me to learn and paint a picture of how the world I live in is in need of computer scientists.
