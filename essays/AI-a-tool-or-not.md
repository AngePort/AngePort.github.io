### I. Introduction
In my academic journey, my professor advocated for the use of AI as a valuable tool, highlighting its potential to enhance our learning and problem-solving abilities. It became evident that AI's effectiveness is directly proportional to our existing knowledge base. However, my experiences with AI, particularly through platforms like ChatGPT, have left me grappling with conflicting emotions. While it undeniably offers swift solutions to queries, it also fosters a sense of dependency that concerns me. There's a temptation to rely on it excessively, undermining the development of my own critical thinking skills. Nevertheless, I acknowledge the profound impact of AI as a groundbreaking invention that demands responsible use. It's essential to treat AI as a tool to be utilized judiciously, supplementing rather than replacing our cognitive capacities.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
- During my experience with WODs (Workouts of the Day), I've found AI to be a helpful tool for tidying up my code and fixing ESLint errors. It's been a time-saver, especially for quickly addressing common issues like missing semicolons or syntax errors. When I hit a wall with a problem I can't seem to crack, I turn to AI and occasionally check out walkthrough videos for a little extra guidance.
2. In-class Practice WODs
- During in-class Practice WODs, I deliberately abstained from using AI. Instead, I opted to challenge myself by relying solely on my ability to comprehend the tasks step by step. This approach proved to be quite beneficial, as it helped me gauge when to resort to AI assistance and when I could efficiently tackle the tasks independently. Surprisingly, I discovered that I could handle the majority of the WODs on my own and successfully complete them without external aid.
3. In-class WODs
- During in-class practice WODs, I've experimented with using AI. I recognize its potential to provide quick solutions, especially when copying and pasting, which often works seamlessly. However, there are instances where even AI struggles to solve the practice WODs. Initially, I refrained from relying on AI because I lacked the know-how to leverage it effectively and ask the right questions for it to assist. Yet, as I delved into the concept of "Smart-Questions," which we've learned, I realized its applicability to AI. This approach helped me navigate towards the necessary steps to tackle the problems effectively. Subsequently, I would refine the solution based on the insights gained, ultimately arriving at the correct solution for the WOD. This experience enhanced my skill in asking "Smart-Questions" and reinforced the understanding that AI's intelligence is contingent on the user's proficiency.
4. Essays
- When it comes to essays, I rely entirely on AI to refine them. To ensure that the essence of my message remains intact, I provide clear instructions to the AI, stating, "This is my 'text'. I would like you to identify any grammatical errors and misspelled words. If there are any nonsensical parts, please bring them to my attention." This approach allows the AI to assist me without altering the core ideas I aim to convey. By incorporating my text into the process, I benefit from the AI's assistance in enhancing the structural integrity of my essays and catching any human errors I may have overlooked.
5. Final project
- For the final project, I've employed AI to address issues that were beyond my comprehension. Tasks like developing our "Special sauce" often demanded extensive brainstorming sessions with the team. However, as students juggling multiple assignments, our time management became a challenge, making it difficult to coordinate meetings at optimal times. Although we scheduled meetings twice a week, the demands of our project's "Special sauce" required more frequent collaboration. AI proved to be invaluable in bridging the gaps by providing assistance and streamlining our thought processes, saving us considerable time and effort.
