### What I took with me
This semester has been both challenging and enlightening, offering a wealth of new knowledge and fostering connections with like-minded peers sharing similar goals. As I reflect on what I've found most valuable to my learning journey, two key aspects stand out: the development environments I've become accustomed to and the agile project management principles I aim to further refine.

### Cool Development Environment!
In a computer science major, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential tools that streamline the software development process. IDEs provide a unified platform for coding, debugging, and testing applications, offering features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and version control integration. They significantly enhance productivity by simplifying complex tasks and providing a cohesive workspace for developers to work efficiently. However, developers may encounter challenges such as resource-intensive nature, steep learning curves, and compatibility issues with certain languages or frameworks. Despite these challenges, IDEs remain indispensable tools for developers due to their ability to streamline workflow and facilitate collaboration within development teams. As a primary IDE, IntelliJ IDEA stands out for its robust feature set and extensive plugin ecosystem. Initially, navigating IntelliJ proved daunting, but with persistence, I've grown comfortable using its functionalities. As I look to the future, I aim to integrate IntelliJ into my professional career, leveraging its capabilities to streamline development processes and enhance productivity in various projects.
