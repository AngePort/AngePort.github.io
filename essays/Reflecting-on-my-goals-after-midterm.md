# Smart Goals!
## Looking at my "smart goals" that I have created.

<img width="200px"
class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src"../img/Reflection-on-my-goals/Striving image.jpeg" >

1) I want to accomplish learning about softwares and how software engineering differs from programming. I will know that I reached this goal when I have created a software or worked with them till it is completed. This is attainable through this class. Its relevant due to the fact that I want to pursue a degree in computer science. Achieved hopefully after this class.

2) I would like to be able to work comfortably with different tools that I have never used to create softwares, programs, and code. I would probably reach this when I have the ability to create and fully understand the background of softwares through the projects that we will have in this course. This is attainable as well through the development of projects that will be completed. Relevance through my goal of trying to understand the ground up of things related to coding. Achieved hopefully after this class as well.

3) I would like to be able to bond and share connections in this class either through the teacher, or students. Having connections and being able to have the skill to work with a team or partner is a must have for me. I will know so through the great value that I have recieved when working with people next to me. Every little group excercise is a practice towards this goal. Its attainable because its a skill that just needs to be sharpened. Relevent to the fact that the world is not lonely. Its something that is Achieved at any time but must be used or the skill will rust.

## Looking back at it now

**SMART Goal 1: Learning about Software Engineering**

Reflecting on my first SMART goal, I embarked on a journey to deepen my understanding of software engineering and distinguish it from mere programming. Throughout this semester, I have diligently immersed myself in exploring various software platforms and dissecting the intricacies of their engineering aspects. From unraveling the functionalities of Intellij to mastering version control with GitHub, I've strived to grasp the essence of software development from conception to completion. Conquering challenging feats like creating applications using Meteor has been instrumental in solidifying my comprehension of software engineering principles. As I look back, I recognize the significant strides I've made towards achieving this goal, each milestone marking a substantial advancement in my journey as a scholar and aspiring computer scientist.

**SMART Goal 2: Proficiency with Tools for Software Development**

In pursuit of my second SMART goal, I endeavored to acquire proficiency with an array of tools essential for software development. Throughout the semester, I've embraced the opportunity to familiarize myself with new technologies and methodologies, enabling me to navigate the complexities of software creation with confidence. Engaging in hands-on projects and delving into the background of software through practical application has empowered me to develop a comprehensive understanding of the tools at my disposal. With each project completed, I've not only honed my technical prowess but also cultivated a deeper appreciation for the foundational aspects of coding. As I reflect on my journey, I am buoyed by the progress made towards this goal, confident that the skills acquired will serve as invaluable assets in my future endeavors in the realm of software development.

**SMART Goal 3: Building Connections and Collaborative Skills**

Turning to my third SMART goal, I set out to foster meaningful connections and cultivate collaborative skills within the academic community. Recognizing the importance of interpersonal relationships and teamwork in the field of computer science, I actively sought opportunities to engage with both peers and instructors. Participating in group exercises and collaborative projects provided me with invaluable experiences to sharpen my collaborative skills and forge lasting connections. Each interaction, whether with a teacher or fellow student, has enriched my learning journey and reinforced the significance of community in achieving shared goals. As I anticipate the culmination of this semester, I am filled with gratitude for the connections established and the collaborative skills honed, knowing that they will continue to shape my growth and success as a future computer scientist.





<!--Knowing that there are three things that I would like to accomplish during this semester looking back at it now, there are big improvements to what I believe as growth within my self as a scholar and a future computer scientist. Further, into the semester I have delved deep into learning how to code using different types of softwares such as Intellij. I've got the hang of using GitHub as well as learning more on how to work with a team on a code. Challenging feats that I have conquered in understanding is creating applications using Meteor and how I can tie React-Bootstrap features to help make the process smoother. These are all things that I have accomplished pertaining to the first and second SMART GOAL. As for my third SMART GOAL this is something that is important to me dur to the fact that it provides a sense of being part of a community that I strive to be in. And when realizing the amount of connections that I have intertwined myself with those who strive for the same SMART GOALS as me , It is a goal that when I finally look back after this spring semester, I know that I have done plus Ultra. -->
