# Skate Park App

## Overview
* The *problem*: Tourists, or just locals wanting to have a BBQ with friends and family may want easy access to possible parks across the island without having to search all over the internet.

* The *solution*: How about a platform that allows users to post/propose possible spots for chill, picnic spots. Upload pictures, post reviews of the spot, leave a rating out of 5 stars.

## Approach

Users can sign in/ register an account on the platform, see the parks available on the island, as well as the weather condition of the area.
* Regular User: Create reviews/pictures, Comment, Look at park availability (rainy).
* Admin User: Same as basic regular users, edit user permissions, remove unnecessary comments/pictures, moderate.

## Use Case Ideas
* User goes to the landing, logs in, gets a home page, searches for parks on the island, posts content relating to a park, or reviews a park.
* New user goes to the landing page, registers, sets up their profile, and gets the homepage to become a user.
* Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, gets a home page with an admin view option. Clicking “admin mode” allows the admin to review the material and use admin privileges.

## Beyond the Basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

* Flag content as inappropriate
* 1-5 star review
* Check to see if the skate park is packed meter
* Add other parks (basketball courts, volleyball, etc)
* Users can add to the list of “Skate Spots”, Admin can either delete or post the spot
* Add events
